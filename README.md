Welcome to my GitHub page. This repository (and others linked here) contains code, analyses, and tools supporting my research in sleep-disordered breathing, ventilatory control, and respiratory physiology—particularly in the context of opioid use and respiratory failure.

## 🔬 Research Focus
- Sleep-disordered breathing (OSA, CSA, opioid-related SDB)
- Control of breathing and ventilatory instability
- Opioid effects on respiration and sleep
- Respiratory muscle function and neuromuscular disease
- Physiologic phenotyping and translational clinical research

## 📊 Methods & Tooling
Common methods and tools used across repositories:
- **Statistical analysis:** R (tidyverse, lme4, emmeans, gtsummary), MATLAB
- **Physiology analysis:** breath-by-breath processing, loop gain estimation, ventilatory instability metrics
- **Clinical data:** polysomnography, CPET, PFTs, wearable and remote monitoring data
- **Study designs:** crossover trials, mixed-effects models, causal inference, mechanistic physiology studies

## 📁 Repository Structure
Individual repositories typically include:
- `data/` – Example or simulated datasets (real patient data not shared)
- `scripts/` – Analysis scripts (R, MATLAB, Python as noted)
- `figures/` – Generated plots and figures
- `docs/` – Supplementary documentation or methods
- `README.md` – Repository-specific description and instructions

## 🔒 Data Use & Privacy
All repositories comply with IRB and data-use requirements.  
No protected health information (PHI) is shared.  
Any shared datasets are simulated, de-identified, or publicly available.

## 📄 Citation
If you use code or methods from this repository in academic work, please cite the associated manuscript when available, or acknowledge the repository.
## 🤝 Collaboration
I welcome:
- Methodological feedback
- Reproducibility improvements
- Scientific collaboration aligned with respiratory physiology and sleep medicine

Please open an issue or contact me directly if you’d like to discuss collaboration.
